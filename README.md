üîê Caesar Cipher Breaking & Enhanced Encryption Project

Overview
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Breaking project! This program goes beyond traditional cryptography by offering a powerful tool to decrypt messages encoded with the Caesar cipher, even when the encryption key is unknown. Combining statistical analysis and brute-force techniques, this program cracks ciphers with remarkable accuracy. It‚Äôs not just about breaking codes‚Äîit also offers robust encryption features using both Caesar and Vigen√®re ciphers with customizable keys and advanced encryption options.

Project Features

1. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Caesar Cipher Decryption
   
The highlight of this project is its ability to break Caesar cipher-encrypted messages without knowing the key. Using a combination of:

>>Statistical Analysis: It analyzes letter frequency to make educated guesses about potential decryption.

>>Brute Force: Cycles through all possible shifts in the Caesar cipher to reveal the most likely decrypted text.

No more guesswork‚Äîlet the program handle the complexity of decoding for you!

2. üîë Enhanced Encryption with Caesar & Vigen√®re Ciphers
   
This tool isn't just about decryption! It also provides a robust encryption system featuring:

>>Caesar Cipher: Simple and effective for basic encryption needs.
>>Vigen√®re Cipher: A more sophisticated encryption method with customizable keys for added security.

Both encryption methods are supported with options for multiple rounds of encryption to ensure that your data remains highly secure.

3. ‚ö° Optimized for Performance
   
The project has been optimized for fast processing and easy readability, even when dealing with large datasets or multiple encryption rounds. Whether you‚Äôre encrypting simple messages or decrypting complex texts, this tool is designed to handle it with efficiency.

5. üîç Clear & Readable Code
   
The code behind this project is structured for clarity, making it accessible to developers who want to dive in, customize, or expand its capabilities. Each step of the decryption and encryption process is well-documented to ensure transparency and ease of understanding.

How It Works?
>>Decrypting a Caesar Cipher:

1)Brute Force: The program tests all possible shifts to decrypt the message.
2)Statistical Analysis: It evaluates the decrypted outputs and identifies the one most likely to be correct based on English language letter frequencies.

>>Encrypting with Caesar or Vigen√®re:

1)Choose either the Caesar Cipher or the more complex Vigen√®re Cipher.
2)Input a custom key and specify the number of encryption rounds for added security.
